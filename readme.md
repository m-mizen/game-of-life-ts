# Game of life

[Game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

Runs pretty slow for now but works.

To compile to javascript, install typescript and run `tsc` from the root directory

Uses CSS grid to position all of the cells. Won't work on older browsers at all.
